Assignment #3 Object Oriented Programming.
Program: The Program consists of security system. It could be easily made more functional but the content was
getting too much to handle for me to add in the UML. I learned to used UML to a better extent. I learned to used 
interfaces where required in this cases the Sensors. Made as many classes as i could and tried to gave some
functionality. I hope this is enough for the level of Assignment.
Waiting for the next Assignment.
